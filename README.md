# Asteroids-Game
This was a project I helped develop early in my education. Two other classmates and I were tasked with creating a version of 
the old school Asteroids game using C++ and OO design. 

The reason for seeing zero commits from me was, again, my lack of understanding of version control. Any contributions I made
are evident in the files I emailed to my partners for them to commit to github. However, verifcation of my contribution
can be provided.
